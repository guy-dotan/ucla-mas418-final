    <h2>About this app</h2>
    </center>

    <p>This app is supposed to be a simple example of how to deploy a shiny app. Work in progress.</p>

    <h2>Number of Clusters</h2>
    <p>Let's take a look at an indicator of how many clusters to choose<p>

    <h3>Percentage of Variance Explained</h3>
    <p>By checking the percentage of variance explained we can understand how much of the between sum of squares variance is explained relative to the total sum of squares at the different cluster values. Most likely we would want to add a screeplot and use the `Elbow Method` to consider the percentage of variance explained at different numbers of clusters all at once.  Will be included in future work.  </p>
