# Broken Docker Files

This was created in an attempt to Dockerize the Shiny app and then deploy it on an Amazon EC2 instance. However this deployment would not work after running `docker-compose up` as it got stuck with the following message `Attaching to shiny...`

If this problem can be resolved I will go back and look into a solution to host this Shiny app on an Amazon instance as opposed to [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).
