# Broken Docker Files

This was created to attempt to Dockerize the Shiny app and then deploy it on an Amazon EC2 instance. However this deployment does not work after running `docker-compose up` as it gets stuck with the following message `Attaching to shiny...`

If this problem can be resolved I will look back into figuring out how to host this Shiny app on an Amazon instance as opposed to [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/)
